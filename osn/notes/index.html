          Recursion — according to Wikipedia — is: “something that occurs when a
          thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type” A nice visual
          example of recursion is when you look at your screen while sharing it
          via VNC, like in this example: Image for post Image for post in which
          there’s your desktop containing a window showing your desktop
          containing a window showing your desktop, and so on… In Computer
          Science, recursion is the act of calling a function from itself and,
          though is not very efficient, I find it one of the most elegant
          programming techniques. In this article we’ll see a lot of examples
          and try to understand the patterns behind recursive algorithms.
          Looping over a list Let’s start with a linked list; if we want to loop
          all the nodes of the list we can either go with a loop (a for or a
          while) or we can use recursion. More specifically, we can define a
          function that given as a parameter a node of the list, it calls itself
          with the following node as a parameter, like in this example:
          Recursively looping over a linked list What’s happening here is quite
          simple: if we call this function with the head of the list (the first
          node of the list), it will first check if that node exists; if true,
          it will print the value of the node and then it will call itself with
          the following node as the parameter and restarts the execution of the
          function. And so on, until it arrives to the end of the list, where a
          node doesn’t have any more following nodes. The structure of a
          recursive function is composed of two parts: a base case (to finish
          recursion) a recursive case (where the function calls itself) In the
          code above we commented as // base case the if condition at the
          beginning of the function: it contains the condition upon which the
          function has to stop; without a base case the function might call
          itself indefinitely, usually until it hits a stack overflow. The rest
          of code following the if statement is the recursive part, the one that
          contains the recursive call and that specifies with which parameters
          the function has to call itself. Let’s get back to the code. If we
          declared these nodes: then the loop() function will output — as
          expected — these values: Node 1 Node 2 Node 3 But what if we change
          the position of the println() statement? What happens if we move it
          after the loop() call, like in this sample: A digression on execution
          stack Before analyzing what happens with this change, let’s make a
          digression on a thing called execution stack (also known as call
          stack). From Wikipedia: “a call stack is a stack data structure that
          stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program”
          so, if the computer is currently executing function A and inside this
          function there’s a call to function B, when it executes the call to
          function B it will save in a data structure the point where it has to
          return when function B will end, together with the current value of
          the variables of function A; this data structure is saved into a stack
          and then the execution will jump into function B; when the execution
          of function B ends, the info contained in the stack will be popped, so
          that the execution can jump back to the proper point in function A
          restoring all the values of the variables, and it then restarts
          executing function A, just after the call to function B. With
          recursive functions the principle is the same: every time a function
          calls itself, it stores the point where it had to come back after the
          call and the values of the variables: the only difference is that the
          point to go to after the call is inside the function itself. The use
          of a stack for storing that info also explains why having a base case
          is so important: the stack has a limited size and if we call the
          recursive function too many times, there won’t be space anymore where
          to store the info, thus generating the infamous Stack Overflow error.
          Let’s get back to our example, in which we moved the println()
          statement from before to after the recursive call. We first call the
          loop() function with recursion.
